    Tool Setup: Use an HDL simulator (like ModelSim, GHDL) and a synthesis tool for your target FPGA (like Vivado for Xilinx, Quartus for Intel/Altera).

    Debouncer Implementation: Find or write a robust button_debouncer.vhd. This is critical.

    BCD Arithmetic: The examples use integer ranges and convert to BCD for output. Incrementing directly in BCD requires specific logic (add 1, if > 9, add 6 (for correction) and carry). Using integers internally might be simpler, converting to BCD only for display/comparison.

    Clock Ticks vs. Continuous Clocks: The examples hint at using clock ticks (single-cycle pulses) to enable counters (rising_edge(clk_1Hz_tick)). This is generally safer than using derived clocks directly (rising_edge(clk_1Hz_out)), avoiding potential clock domain crossing issues within the logic. Modify the clk_divider and consuming modules accordingly if using ticks.

    Pin Assignments: Create a constraints file (.xdc, .ucf, .sdc) to map the top-level ports (clk_in, reset_in, btn_*, segment_out, anode_out, alarm_led) to the physical pins on your FPGA board.

    Simulation: Write a thorough testbench (top_level_tb.vhd) to simulate button presses, mode changes, time progression, alarm matching, and stopwatch operation before synthesizing and programming the FPGA.

    Refinement: Add features like time setting, display blinking during set modes, AM/PM indicator, handling invalid BCD inputs more gracefully, etc.

    Resource Usage: Be mindful of FPGA resources, especially if using a smaller device.
